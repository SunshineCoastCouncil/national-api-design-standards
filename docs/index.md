# National API Standards 

The National API Design Standards (NAPIDS) enable developers building APIs to move past common decision points quickly by referencing pre-agreed, best practice design patterns and implementing their APIs according to these standards.
  
This common design standard simplifies the process for both consumers and developers of APIs, accelerating API uptake and use. 
 
The NAPIDS are unique. They are designed for participation with API development communities within and outside government by combining the best of open-source software development practice and culture with administrative rigour and oversight.
