# Australian Government - API Design Standard - DRAFT FOR REVIEW.

These API standards are a starting point for collaboration across government to ensure interoperability is front of mind when creating or modifying digital services across government.

This repository is being used to seek feedback from the working group, and also provide a view to the general public on the standards that are being created within government.  These standards should also be applicable for entites outside of government and their use is encouraged.

For more information see the contact information below.

You can read the latest version of the standard [here](api-standards.md).

# Contributing to this standard 

We're committed to undertaking conversations relating to the technical standards in the open. Questions or comments that participants might ask us via email or private message are likely to be questions or comments other participants have as well. Our answers will be of interest to everyone. There are likely to be experiences and lessons everybody working in this ecosystem can learn from. Having these conversations transparently helps us reduce duplication, resolve issues faster and keep everyone up to date with the conversation.

We ask that all contributors to the Australian Government API Standards repositories comply with the [GitHub Community Forum Code of Conduct](https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-forum-code-of-conduct/).

In addition, it would be appreciated if the following rules are adhered to when commenting or contributing:

- Please provide a single, considered response to each proposal covering all feedback concerning the proposal.

- For transparency, if you work at or are associated with an organisation with an interest in the standards, please indicate this in your response.

- Please ensure you are aware of and compliant with any social media guidelines or internal processes for response set by your organisation before providing feedback.

# Building for Distribution

This standard is broken into a number of sections that are available in the sections folder.  These can be rebuilt, and a table of contents generated using the build tool `gulp`.

The process to get this set up is as follows:

1. Install npm and node.js (npm: 6.9.0 / node: 10.16.0)
2. Install gulp-cli and gulp (`npm install gulp-cli -g && npm install gulp -D`)
3. Install project dependencies (`npm install --save`)
4. Run gulp (`gulp`)

This will create a `target` directory with a combined.md and combined.pdf files for use.
